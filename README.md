# Merge-K-SortedLists
Program merges multiple singly linked lists into one singly linked list, organized by ascending order. Program uses Priority Queues (PQ) to handle the logic of ascending order. Once a correct order is established, a new merged linked list is made out of the data passed by the multiple linked lists.
