# Merge-K-SortedLists
Program merges multiple singly linked lists into one singly linked list, organized by ascending order. Program uses Priority Queues (PQ) to handle the logic of ascending order. Once a correct order is established, a new merged linked list is made out of the data passed by the multiple linked lists.

## Modifying File // Adding Multiple Linked Lists
Multiple linked lists may be made in the Main function (line 91). Linked lists will have integers. Size of each individual linked list is determined by user. 
1. Add more linked lists by copy-pasting code from list1 (lines 93-98)
2. Change names to newly created linked lists to be unique (ex, list3, list4, list5...)
3. Add newly created linked lists below "megalist" (line 114). See code example on line 112 & 113
4. Change number on line 111 to match how many total linked lists you have. 
5. Run program
